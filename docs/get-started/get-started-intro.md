## Invoice recording solution
We are going to build a **invoice recording solution** using nimflow and Microsoft Power Automate Desktop. We use Microsoft Power Automate Desktop but nimflow is technology agnostic, so you can use whatever Robotic Process Automation solution you like.

## Before we start
Please ensure you have access to [nimflow studio](https://ins.studio.nimflow.com/). If you haven't already, please request access to support@nimflow.com

## Help

This solution is simple enough that we expect you not find any issue, but if you do, please reach out to us on support@nimflow.com.
