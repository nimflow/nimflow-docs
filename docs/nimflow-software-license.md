            https://mit-license.org/

        for full terms.  Nimflow Open-Source is a no-cost license and as
        such, contains the following disclaimers: NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO
        THE CONTRARY HEREIN, NIMFLOW SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS
        AVAILABLE", AND ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AND
        DISCLAIMED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
        MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE IN LAW OR FROM
        COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USE IN TRADE.  For
        clarity, the terms of this Agreement, other than the relevant
        definitions in Section 1 and this Section 2(a) do not apply to Nimflow Software.

    (b) License to Nimflow Software.

      i   Grant of Copyright License: Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
          Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable limited
          license to install and use Nimflow Software for Your business purposes, for so long
          as You are not in violation of this Section 2(b) and are currenton all payments 
          required by Section 4 below.

      ii  Grant of Patent License: Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
          Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, non-exclusive,
          non-transferable limited patent license to install and use Nimflow Software, 
          where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by Licensor 
          that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of
          their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
          submitted.  If You institute patent litigation against any entity
          (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
          the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
          direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as
          of the date such litigation is filed.

      iii License to Third Party Works:  From time to time Nimflow may
          use, or provide You access to, Third Party Works in connection
          with Nimflow Software.  You acknowledge and agree that in addition 
          to this Agreement, Your use of Third Party Works is subjectto all other terms 
          and conditions set forth in the License provided with or contained in such Third
          Party Works. Some Third Party Works may be licensed to You solely for use with
          Nimflow Software under the terms of a third party License, or as otherwise
          notified by Nimflow, and not under the terms of this Agreement.  You agree that 
          the owners and third party licensors of Third Party Works are intended third party
          beneficiaries to this Agreement.

  3. Support.  From time to time, in its sole discretion, Nimflow may
     offer professional services or support for Nimflow Software, which may now or in
     the future be subject to additional fees.

  4. Fees for Nimflow Software or Nimflow Support.

    (a) Fees.  The License to Nimflow Software is conditioned upon Your payment
        of the fees which You agree to pay to Nimflow in accordance with the payment terms
        agreed upon by contacting contact@nimflow.com. Any professional services or support for 
        Nimflow Software may also be subject to Your payment of fees, which will be
        specified by Nimflow when you sign up to receive such professional services or support.  
        Nimflow reserves the right to change the fees at any time with prior written notice;
        for recurring fees, any such adjustments will take effect as of the next pay period.

    (b) Overdue Payments and Taxes. Overdue payments are subject to a service
        charge equal to the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum legal
        interest rate allowed by law, and You shall pay all Nimflow’
        reasonable costs of collection, including court costs and attorneys’
        fees.  Fees are stated and payable in U.S. dollars and are exclusive of
        all sales, use, value added and similar taxes, duties, withholdings and
        other governmental assessments (but excluding taxes based on Nimflow’ income)
        that may be levied on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any jurisdiction,
        all of which are Your responsibility unless you have provided Nimflow with a valid tax-exempt
        certificate.

    (c) Record-keeping and Audit.  If fees for Nimflow Software are based on the number 
        of cores or servers running on Nimflow Software or another use-based unit of measurement,
        You must maintain complete and accurate records with respect to Your use of Nimflow Software
        and will provide such records to Nimflow for inspection or audit upon Nimflow’ 
        reasonable request.  If an inspection or audit uncovers additional usage by You for
        which fees are owed under this Agreement, then You shall pay for such
        additional usage at Nimflow’ then-current rates.

  5. Trial License.  If You have signed up for a trial or evaluation of
     Nimflow Software, Your License to Nimflow Software is granted without charge
     for the trial or evaluation period specified when You signed up, or if no term was specified, 
     for thirty (30) calendar days, provided that Your License is granted solely for purposes of
     Your internal evaluation of Nimflow Software during the trial or evaluation 
     period (a "Trial License"). You may not use Nimflow Software under a Trial License more
     than once in any twelve (12) month period.  Nimflow may revoke a Trial License at any time and
     for any reason.  Sections 3, 4, 9 and 11 of this Agreement do not apply to
     Trial Licenses.

  6. Responsibilities.  
     
    (a) Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or required to be permitted by applicable law,
        You will not cause or permit the transfer, loan, lease, publication, or use of Nimflow Software
        to or for the benefit of any third party without the prior written consent of Nimflow. 
        
    (b) You will not reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of
        Nimflow Software. You will use Nimflow Software provided in source code form only to modify or
        enhance Software for its authorized use. You will not otherwise modify, adapt, or merge Software.
        You will not subject Software to any open source software license that conflicts with this Agreement.
        You will not use Software for the purpose of developing or enhancing any product that is competitive
        with Nimflow Software. You will only use APIs identified as published in the Documentation and only 
        as described therein to support the authorized use of Software. The restrictions set out in this 
        Section do not apply to the extent they conflict with mandatory applicable law.

    (c) You may only engage a third party to host Nimflow Software (“Provider”) with Nimflow prior written
        consent. Nimflow may require a separate written agreement as a condition to such consent. 
        Nimflow Software hosted by a Provider must remain under Your’s sole control at all times, unless
        management and operation of Nimflow Software by the Provider is explicitly approved by Nimflow,
        in which case You will ensure that the Provider manages and operates Nimflow Software in conformance
        with this Agreement and solely for Your’sinternal business purposes as permitted herein. If Your 
        becomes aware of any actual or suspected unauthorized use or disclosure of Nimflow Software, Your 
        shall immediately terminate Provider’s access to Nimflow Software. A breach of this Agreement caused 
        by a Provider will constitute a breach by You. You will indemnify and hold Nimflow and its affiliates
        harmless from all claims, damages, fines, and costs (including attorney’s fees and expenses) arising
        in connection with Your’s use of the Provider’s services. Your will notify Nimflow if the Provider
        or its relevant business comes under the control of a third party, in which case Nimflow may withdraw
        its prior consent. 
        
  7. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
     Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in Nimflow by You to
     Nimflow shall be under the terms and conditions of

         https://cla-assistant.io/nimflow-com/nimflow

     (which is based off of the MIT License), without any additional terms or
     conditions, payments of royalties or otherwise to Your benefit.
     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the
     terms of any separate license agreement You may have executed with
     Nimflow regarding such Contributions.

  8. Trademarks.  This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
     trademarks, service marks, or product names of Licensor, except as required
     for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
     reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  9. Limited Warranty.

    (a) Warranties.  Nimflow warrants to You that: (i) Nimflow will materially
        perform in accordance with the applicable documentation for ninety (90) days
        after initial delivery to You; and (ii) any professional services performed by 
        Nimflow under this Agreement will be performed in a workmanlike manner, in
        accordance with general industry standards.

    (b) Exclusions.  Nimflow’ warranties in this Section 9 do not extend
        to problems that result from: (i) Your failure to implement updates
        issued by Nimflow during the warranty period; (ii) any alterations or
        additions (including Contributions) to Nimflow
        Software not performed by or at the direction of Nimflow; (iii) failures 
        that are not reproducible by Nimflow; (iv) operation of Nimflow Software 
        in violation of this Agreement or not in accordance with its documentation;
        (v) failures caused by software, hardware or products not licensed or provided
        by Nimflow hereunder; or (vi) Third Party Works.

    (c) Remedies.  In the event of a breach of a warranty under this Section 9,
        Nimflow will, at its discretion and cost, either repair, replace
        or re-perform the applicable Works or services or refund a portion of
        fees previously paid to Nimflow that are associated with the
        defective Works or services. This is Your exclusive remedy, and
        Nimflow’ sole liability, arising in connection with the limited
        warranties herein.

  10. Disclaimer of Warranty.  Except as set out in Section 9, unless required
      by applicable law, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor
      provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
      CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, arising out of course
      of dealing, course of performance, or usage in trade, including, without
      limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
      MERCHANTABILITY, CORRECTNESS, RELIABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, all of which are hereby disclaimed.  You are solely responsible
      for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing Works and
      assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under the
      applicable License for such Works.

  11. Limited Indemnity.

    (a) Indemnity.  Nimflow will defend, indemnify and hold You harmless
        against any third party claims, liabilities or expenses incurred
        (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), as well as amounts finally
        awarded in a settlement or a non-appealable judgement by a court
        ("Losses"), to the extent arising from any claim or allegation by a
        third party that Nimflow Software infringes or misappropriates
        a valid United States patent, copyright or trade secret right of a third party;
        provided that You give Nimflow: (i) prompt written notice of any such claim or 
        allegation; (ii) sole control of the defense and settlement thereof; and 
        (iii) reasonable cooperation and assistance in such defense or settlement.
        If any Work within Nimflow Software becomes or, in Nimflow’ opinion,
        is likely to become, the subject of an injunction, Nimflow may, at its option,
        (A) procure for You the right to continue using such Work, (B) replace or modify
        such Work so that it becomes non-infringing without substantially compromising 
        its functionality, or, if (A) and (B) are not commercially practicable, then (C)
        terminate Your license to the allegedly infringing Work and refund to You a 
        prorated portion of the prepaid and unearned fees for such infringing Work.
        The foregoing states the entire liability of Nimflow with respect to
        infringement of patents, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual
        property rights.

    (b) Exclusions.  The foregoing obligations shall not apply to: (i) Works
        modified by any party other than Nimflow (including Contributions), if the
        alleged infringement relates to such modification, (ii) Works combined or bundled
        with any product, processes or materials not provided by Nimflow where the alleged
        infringement relates to such combination, (iii) use of a version of
        Nimflow other than the version that was current at the time of such use,
        as long as a non-infringing version had been released, (iv) any Works
        created to Your specifications, (v) infringement or misappropriation of any proprietary
        right in which You have an interest, or (vi) Third Party Works. You will defend,
        indemnify and hold Nimflow harmless against any Losses arising from any
        such claim or allegation, subject to conditions reciprocal to those in
        Section 11(a).

  12. Limitation of Liability.  In no event and under no legal or equitable
      theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts), and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
      contrary, shall Licensor or any Contributor be liable to You for (i) any
      amounts in excess, in the aggregate, of the fees paid by You to Nimflow
      under this Agreement in the twelve (12) months preceding the date the
      first cause of liability arose), or (ii) any indirect, special,
      incidental, punitive, exemplary, reliance, or consequential damages of any
      character arising as a result of this Agreement or out of the use or
      inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss
      of goodwill, profits, data or data use, work stoppage, computer failure or
      malfunction, cost of procurement of substitute goods, technology or
      services, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
      Licensor or Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
      damages. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE
      ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

  13. General.

    (a) Relationship of Parties.  You and Nimflow are independent
        contractors, and nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute either
        party as the agent or representative of the other or both parties as
        joint venturers or partners for any purpose.

    (b) Export Control.  You shall comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
        Practices Act and all applicable export laws, restrictions and
        regulations of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and any other applicable
        U.S. and foreign authority.

    (c) Assignment.  This Agreement and the rights and obligations herein may
        not be assigned or transferred, in whole or in part, by You without the
        prior written consent of Nimflow.  Any assignment in violation of
        this provision is void.  This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure
        to the benefit of, the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.

    (d) Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under
        the laws of the State of New York and the United States without regard
        to conflicts of laws provisions thereof, and without regard to the
        Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.

    (e) Attorneys’ Fees.  In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under
        this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its
        costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees.

    (f) Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid,
        illegal or unenforceable in any respect, that provision shall be limited
        or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement
        otherwise remains in full force and effect and enforceable.

    (g) Entire Agreement; Waivers; Modification.  This Agreement constitutes the
        entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter
        hereof and supersedes all proposals, understandings, or discussions,
        whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this
        Agreement and all past dealing or industry custom. The failure of either
        party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any
        period shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights. No changes,
        modifications or waivers to this Agreement will be effective unless in
        writing and signed by both parties.
