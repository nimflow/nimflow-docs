# Welcome to nimflow

nimflow is a reactive task orchestrator for hyper-automation solutions. It enables makers to build complex solutions integrating seamlessly human and digital workers. 

nimflow was inspired by [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) and works similar to **Microsoft Excel**. **Tasks** in nimflow reacts to changes in the state, like a formula in Microsoft Excel reacts to changes in referenced cells. This reactivity simplifies the orchestration in comparisson to sequential models like [BPMN](https://www.bpmn.org/).
