and conditions set forth in the License provided with or contained in such Third
Party Works. Some Third Party Works may be licensed to You solely for use with
Nimflow Software under the terms of a third party License, or as otherwise
notified by Nimflow, and not under the terms of this Agreement.  You agree that
the owners and third party licensors of Third Party Works are intended third party
beneficiaries to this Agreement.</p></li><li><p>Support.  From time to time, in its sole discretion, Nimflow may
offer professional services or support for Nimflow Software, which may now or in
the future be subject to additional fees.</p></li><li><p>Fees for Nimflow Software or Nimflow Support.</p><p>(a) Fees.  The License to Nimflow Software is conditioned upon Your payment
of the fees which You agree to pay to Nimflow in accordance with the payment terms
agreed upon by contacting <a href="mailto:contact@nimflow.com." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact@nimflow.com.</a> Any professional services or support for
Nimflow Software may also be subject to Your payment of fees, which will be
specified by Nimflow when you sign up to receive such professional services or support.<br>
Nimflow reserves the right to change the fees at any time with prior written notice;
for recurring fees, any such adjustments will take effect as of the next pay period.</p><p>(b) Overdue Payments and Taxes. Overdue payments are subject to a service
charge equal to the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum legal
interest rate allowed by law, and You shall pay all Nimflow’
reasonable costs of collection, including court costs and attorneys’
fees.  Fees are stated and payable in U.S. dollars and are exclusive of
all sales, use, value added and similar taxes, duties, withholdings and
other governmental assessments (but excluding taxes based on Nimflow’ income)
that may be levied on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any jurisdiction,
all of which are Your responsibility unless you have provided Nimflow with a valid tax-exempt
certificate.</p><p>(c) Record-keeping and Audit.  If fees for Nimflow Software are based on the number
of cores or servers running on Nimflow Software or another use-based unit of measurement,
You must maintain complete and accurate records with respect to Your use of Nimflow Software
and will provide such records to Nimflow for inspection or audit upon Nimflow’
reasonable request.  If an inspection or audit uncovers additional usage by You for
which fees are owed under this Agreement, then You shall pay for such
additional usage at Nimflow’ then-current rates.</p></li><li><p>Trial License.  If You have signed up for a trial or evaluation of
Nimflow Software, Your License to Nimflow Software is granted without charge
for the trial or evaluation period specified when You signed up, or if no term was specified,
for thirty (30) calendar days, provided that Your License is granted solely for purposes of
Your internal evaluation of Nimflow Software during the trial or evaluation
period (a &quot;Trial License&quot;). You may not use Nimflow Software under a Trial License more
than once in any twelve (12) month period.  Nimflow may revoke a Trial License at any time and
for any reason.  Sections 3, 4, 9 and 11 of this Agreement do not apply to
Trial Licenses.</p></li><li><p>Responsibilities.  </p><p>(a) Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or required to be permitted by applicable law,
You will not cause or permit the transfer, loan, lease, publication, or use of Nimflow Software
to or for the benefit of any third party without the prior written consent of Nimflow. </p><p>(b) You will not reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of
Nimflow Software. You will use Nimflow Software provided in source code form only to modify or
enhance Software for its authorized use. You will not otherwise modify, adapt, or merge Software.
You will not subject Software to any open source software license that conflicts with this Agreement.
You will not use Software for the purpose of developing or enhancing any product that is competitive
with Nimflow Software. You will only use APIs identified as published in the Documentation and only

Section do not apply to the extent they conflict with mandatory applicable law.</p><p>(c) You may only engage a third party to host Nimflow Software (“Provider”) with Nimflow prior written
consent. Nimflow may require a separate written agreement as a condition to such consent.
Nimflow Software hosted by a Provider must remain under Your’s sole control at all times, unless
management and operation of Nimflow Software by the Provider is explicitly approved by Nimflow,
in which case You will ensure that the Provider manages and operates Nimflow Software in conformance
with this Agreement and solely for Your’sinternal business purposes as permitted herein. If Your
becomes aware of any actual or suspected unauthorized use or disclosure of Nimflow Software, Your
shall immediately terminate Provider’s access to Nimflow Software. A breach of this Agreement caused
by a Provider will constitute a breach by You. You will indemnify and hold Nimflow and its affiliates
harmless from all claims, damages, fines, and costs (including attorney’s fees and expenses) arising
in connection with Your’s use of the Provider’s services. Your will notify Nimflow if the Provider
or its relevant business comes under the control of a third party, in which case Nimflow may withdraw
its prior consent.

Nimflow regarding such Contributions.</p></li><li><p>Trademarks.  This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or product names of Licensor, except as required
for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p></li><li><p>Limited Warranty.</p><p>(a) Warranties.  Nimflow warrants to You that: (i) Nimflow will materially

after initial delivery to You; and (ii) any professional services performed by

defective Works or services. This is Your exclusive remedy, and
Nimflow’ sole liability, arising in connection with the limited
warranties herein.</p></li><li><p>Disclaimer of Warranty.  Except as set out in Section 9, unless required
by applicable law, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor
provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, arising out of course
of dealing, course of performance, or usage in trade, including, without
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, CORRECTNESS, RELIABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

provided that You give Nimflow: (i) prompt written notice of any such claim or
allegation; (ii) sole control of the defense and settlement thereof; and
(iii) reasonable cooperation and assistance in such defense or settlement.

such Work so that it becomes non-infringing without substantially compromising
its functionality, or, if (A) and (B) are not commercially practicable, then (C)

prorated portion of the prepaid and unearned fees for such infringing Work.
The foregoing states the entire liability of Nimflow with respect to
infringement of patents, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual
property rights.</p><p>(b) Exclusions.  The foregoing obligations shall not apply to: (i) Works
modified by any party other than Nimflow (including Contributions), if the
alleged infringement relates to such modification, (ii) Works combined or bundled
with any product, processes or materials not provided by Nimflow where the alleged
infringement relates to such combination, (iii) use of a version of
Nimflow other than the version that was current at the time of such use,
as long as a non-infringing version had been released, (iv) any Works
created to Your specifications, (v) infringement or misappropriation of any proprietary
right in which You have an interest, or (vi) Third Party Works. You will defend,
indemnify and hold Nimflow harmless against any Losses arising from any
such claim or allegation, subject to conditions reciprocal to those in
Section 11(a).</p></li><li><p>Limitation of Liability.  In no event and under no legal or equitable
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts), and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shall Licensor or any Contributor be liable to You for (i) any
amounts in excess, in the aggregate, of the fees paid by You to Nimflow
under this Agreement in the twelve (12) months preceding the date the
first cause of liability arose), or (ii) any indirect, special,
incidental, punitive, exemplary, reliance, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this Agreement or out of the use or
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss
of goodwill, profits, data or data use, work stoppage, computer failure or
malfunction, cost of procurement of substitute goods, technology or
services, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
Licensor or Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.</p></li><li><p>General.</p><p>(a) Relationship of Parties.  You and Nimflow are independent
contractors, and nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute either
party as the agent or representative of the other or both parties as
joint venturers or partners for any purpose.</p><p>(b) Export Control.  You shall comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and all applicable export laws, restrictions and
regulations of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and any other applicable
U.S. and foreign authority.</p><p>(c) Assignment.  This Agreement and the rights and obligations herein may
not be assigned or transferred, in whole or in part, by You without the
prior written consent of Nimflow.  Any assignment in violation of
this provision is void.  This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure
to the benefit of, the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.</p><p>(d) Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under
the laws of the State of New York and the United States without regard
to conflicts of laws provisions thereof, and without regard to the
Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.</p><p>(e) Attorneys’ Fees.  In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under
this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its
costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees.</p><p>(f) Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect, that provision shall be limited
or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement
otherwise remains in full force and effect and enforceable.</p><p>(g) Entire Agreement; Waivers; Modification.  This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all proposals, understandings, or discussions,
whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement and all past dealing or industry custom. The failure of either
party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any
period shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights. No changes,
modifications or waivers to this Agreement will be effective unless in
writing and signed by both parties.</p></li></ol></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/nimflow/nimflow-docs/tree/main/docs/nimflow-software-license.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Editar essa página</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Navigação das páginas de documentação"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/pt/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Anterior</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">« Welcome</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/pt/tutorial/tutorial-intro"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Próxima</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Introduction to nimflow »</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#nimflow-license-agreement" class="table-of-contents__link">Nimflow License Agreement</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Documentation</div></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2021 nimflow LLC.
